# 24blogger

We are open-source advocates and spent autumn of 2015 building 24blogger mobile app.

How it all got started? Our friend (blogger from Berlin) approached us to help him develop mobile app for his readers. And we decided to build app and give it to him for free, as a gift.

Later we've asked ourselves – how we can help other bloggers be always connected with the world, provide them with additional communication channel, and tool for better engagement with readers? And answer was pretty straightforward - in todays world mobile apps play important role and have become integral part of the people’s lives. With the help of mobile app people order pizza, shop for purchases, read news, watch movies, communicate with friends and even cheat on exams. The whole world goes mobile!

24blogger was developed by our team developers and easily integrates with any blog on Wordpress platform. With little customization it can work with virtually any platform. We plan to gradually improve our app by adding new features and post new releases every other month.

If you need help to figure out how to integrate 24blogger with your blog, just contact alex(at)kakaduapp(dot)com with any queries.

Cheers,

24blogger / Kakaduapp team
